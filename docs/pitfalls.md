# Pitfalls in Historical Lexicography

<p align="right">Gleanings from HuangSupplement</p>

## diachronic semantics

```diff
- 汽車,2,noun,1855,,B. Hobson『博物新編』,
+ 汽車,2,noun,1903,近有法人与英人及他国人合擬賭賽。汽車由法京巴黎斯至日斯巴尼亜京城馬得利脱。,『申報』5月27日「賽車肇事」,
```

汽車 always meant train in the 19th century. All exx. in Chao (2016), p. 232, actually refer to trains.

That's Chu Chün-sheng's 望文生訓.

[184802e](https://github.com/t18d/HuangSupplement/commit/184802ea9877186b40b7e33c3b3a4d7926029dfb), [f7352a1](https://github.com/t18d/HuangSupplement/commit/f7352a1d426877852ee4ceca7a91740278a6612e)

## encyclopedic lemma

_Han yü ta tz'u tien_ (2nd edn), s.v. 二十四史:

> 指二十四部纪传体史书。明有二十一史之目，清乾隆四年又增《明史》《旧唐书》《旧五代史》，合称“二十四史”。

This creates the impression that the name 二十四史 first appeared c1739. The actual use of the word, however, came much later:

```diff
+ 二十四史,/,noun,c1796 (c1791),余在長沙養疾讀史記以下諸史日有恆課摘二十四史同姓名錄,汪輝祖『病榻夢痕錄·卷下』49 (XD104),cf. 與歐陽脩書並列共爲二十有四: c1795 (四庫總目卷四十五)
```

The name always came after the thing unless the thing was actually named at the time it was created.

## etymology _vs_ semantics

```diff
+ 方言,dialect,noun,1906,「統一方言說畧」,"沈敦和 in『寰球中國學生報』1/1, 26",
+ 方言學,dialectology,noun,1920,(表)訓詁{縱方面、—古訓學 橫方面、—現代方言學,沈兼士 in『時事新報』8月31日第七版,
```

Anyone with a cursory familiarity with the modern **lingua franca** will understand _fang yen_ in the sense of 'dialect'. A word's meaning in current Mandarin has _nothing_ to do with its **etymology** in pre-modern Chinese.

See also [**consistency of sets**](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/dictionary/#sets-consistency-of).

## general _vs_ technical vocabulary

```diff
+ 方言,dialect,noun,1906,「統一方言說畧」,"沈敦和 in『寰球中國學生報』1/1, 26",
```

A word's meaning in everyday language is _not_ determined by [how it's defined in specialist textbooks](https://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp029_chinese_dialect.pdf).

## IC analysis

>> 忠厚老成者擯之為無能，俠少儇辨者取之為可用，守道愛國者謂之為流俗，敗常害民者謂之為通變。
>
> I do not think 愛國者 here is a constituent. I'm leaning towards `[[守道][愛國]者]謂之為流俗` where 者 is not attached to 愛國 as a suffix.

## new edition, new name

> Schmidt mistakenly dated _Hand Book of New Terms and Newspaper Chinese_ to 1913, when it was first published in 1917 (see [preface](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021731313&seq=9) in the book dated 1917, where Mateer stated that the 1917 _Hand Book of New Terms and Newspaper Chinese_ was an improvement to the _New Terms for New Ideas_ published in 1913.

## no punctuation

```diff
- 布丁,/,noun,1843,土產西洋布丁、香肉、果水、安息、蘇合油之屬,魏源『海國圖志』卷十五,
```

The correct reading is 西洋布、丁香、肉果、水安息、蘇合油.

## original punctuation

>> It was a 。 in the 1934 edition of [飲冰室全集](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SSID-13347803_%E9%A3%B2%E5%86%B0%E5%AE%A4%E5%85%A8%E9%9B%86_%E4%B8%8A.pdf). 自由書 was originally written in 1899.
>
> This is actually non-trivial: even when an author personally oversaw the production of their own collected edition, there’s no guarantee that what they print there reflects what they printed the first time.
>
> What gets changed may be a punctuation mark, but it could just as likely be a word.

## original _vs_ translation

The following texts are commonly cited in scholarship from a translation instead of the original version:

- 古今情海
- 彭公案 (CCL)
- 泣紅亭

Always use a [checklist of editions](https://github.com/t18d/HuangSupplement/wiki/Checklist-of-Editions)!

## reinventing the wheel

```diff
- 本文,the original (text),noun,1857,合衆領事、及日本官、於兩國方言文字、均不能互相明曉、故於合約中准用荷蘭字為本文,"『六合叢談』1/12, 11",
```

本文 in this sense dates back to 3rd century

```diff
- 本土,local,adjective,1857,有本土邏卒四人、為華民所殺,"『六合叢談』1/4, 15+",
```

This sense of 本土 dates back to 11th century

## reverse translation

```diff
- 內容,/,noun,1839,,林則徐『嚴禁本地民人與外人非法往來交易告示』,
```

Even the very title of this proclamation came from a translation by the editors of Lin. See https://books.google.com/books?id=ngMMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA212.

> 為迄今中外資料中未見原文者，現按英文譯回來。

## same set, same period

```diff
- 槍彈,/,noun,1874,大日斯巴尼亞國 定造鎗並鎗彈,"『萬國公報』306, 21?",
- 槍械,/,noun,1872,…,志剛『初使泰西記』,
+ 槍彈,/,noun,s.xvii,受數百槍彈從脅穿透,『行在陽秋·下』,
+ 槍械,/,noun,1600,疏火器鳥銃長短槍械法,『譚襄敏奏議·序』,
```

槍彈 & 槍械 are in a set with 槍砲 (1643) and should date from the same period.

Cf. [**consistency of sets**](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/dictionary/#sets-consistency-of).

## same word, different orthography

```diff
+ 偶像,/,noun,1927,我好像也已經成了偶象了,魯迅『兩地書·一〇五』,metaphorical
```

A word is a word whatever its surface orthography. The phenomenon, of course, is a very old one in Chinese.

See further [**Orthographic alternation**](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/grammar/#orthographic-alternation).

[2247d61](https://github.com/t18d/HuangSupplement/commit/2247d61a7a29015fe309c1d910501e839677ada1)

## same year, whose priority?

```diff
- 兵工廠,/,noun,1917,"Arsenal 軍械局, 兵工廠","A. H. Mateer, _Hand Book of New Terms and Newspaper Chinese_",
```

>> Antedating fails. Huang cites 朱執信 1917 中國存亡問題 as a source.
>
>Mateer’s cut-off date was mid-1916 according to herself, and Chu is known to be penning his in 1917. We do want to establish the exact priority here.
