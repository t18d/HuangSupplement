## Dictionary

Neologisms in a dictionary can enter the user's vocabulary. Scholars used to
believe that 愛人(2) wasn't used in natural texts until the late 1910s after
英華大辭典 (1908) borrowed it from 雙解英和大辭典. It's now turned up in a
serialised novel from 1909, which is only to be expected.

## Etymology

The etymology of 方言 doesn't change the fact that its current sense is largely
determined by how the English term _dialect_ is understood in modern
linguistics.

## Hallucination

The phrase \[守道]\[愛國]者 doesn't constitute an attestation of 愛國者.

## Naming

All twenty-four of the Standard Histories were in existence by c1739, but the name
二十四史 came only in c1791.

## OCR

安樂椅子 wasn't initially found in the _Hand Book of New Terms and Newspaper
Chinese_ because 樂 got dropped in HathiTrust's OCR layer.

## Omission

Kaufman (2012) notes:

> Often, in reading those publications, one comes across words not in the
> lexica sitting right next to unusual words that are included! What is going
> on? My explanation for this strange state of affairs, based on my own
> experience reading new (to me) materials, is that words of obvious meaning in
> their context never had to be looked up, hence those sage European scholars
> never realized that they were missing from the dictionaries! Computerized
> analysis programs are far less likely to miss such things, however, so the
> more texts we input into our databases the more we learn, be they well-known
> texts or only recently published ones.

## Paraphrase

The following texts are commonly cited in scholarship from a modern paraphrase
instead of the original version:

- 古今情海
- 彭公案 (CCL)
- 泣紅亭

Always use a [checklist of editions](https://github.com/t18d/HuangSupplement/wiki/Checklist-of-Editions)!

## Polysemy

Yang (2021) notes that the figurative use of 榨取 was imported from Japanese
a year earlier than the physical sense. The transmission of polysemous
loanwords has its own logic. See also s.v. 病毒.

## Punctuation

Chao (2016) reads 西洋布丁、香肉、果水、安息、蘇合油 for the correct
西洋布、丁香、肉果、水安息、蘇合油.

## Rebrand

The _Hand Book of New Terms and Newspaper Chinese_ (1917) was the 2nd edition
of _New Terms for New Ideas_ (1913). Words first attested in the former
shouldn't be dated to 1913.

## Referent

汽車 was train in the 19th century.

## Translation

Lin's 嚴禁本地民人與外人非法往來交易告示 (1839), including the very title, is a
translation of [the English version](https://books.google.com/books?id=ngMMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA212):

> 為迄今中外資料中未見原文者，現按英文譯回來。
