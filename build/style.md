Registers are a blind spot of traditional [Mandarin
lexicography](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/tally/).

Through a general unfamiliarity with the literature of the Republican period, for
many everyday objects often the only expression that exists in the
lexicographer's idiolect is a **colloquialism**.

A word can also become associated with careless writers, including

1. bureaucrats who exaggerate whatever they do;
2. writers who didn't master Mandarin before they start publishing;
3. writers who borrow from Japanese in abundance due to (2);
4. writers who translate English terminology in broken Mandarin due to (2).
